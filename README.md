# Gibbs Random Field for Colletive Swarm Transportation tasks

## TODO List
- [ ] Publish current velocity and distance to target of the object
- [] Check targetOcclusion function
    - [] Robot position preditor?
    - [] Define logit function to feed potentials parameters

- [ ] Add robot-dead feature
- [ ] How heterogeneity will work?
- [x] Target by using gazebo to move the target_box
- [ ] Current gradient is not suitable (need other strategy)

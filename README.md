# Gibbs Random Field for Colletive Swarm Transportation tasks

## TODO List
- [ ] Publish current velocity and distance to target of the object
- [ ] Check targetOcclusion function
    - [x] Robot position preditor?
    - [ ] Define logit function to feed potentials parameters
- [ ] Improve loop-performance
- [ ] Add robot-dead feature
- [ ] How heterogeneity will work?
- [x] Target by using gazebo to move the target_box
- [x] Current gradient is not suitable (need other strategy)
